I'm a Researcher and Group Leader at the [Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS)](https://www.lnls.cnpem.br), which is part of the [Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM)](https://cnpem.br) and responsible for operating the Sirius particle accelerator. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br), Brazil (2011), and earned my Master's (2013) and Ph.D. (2018) degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Campinas (Unicamp)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp). Part of my doctoral studies was conducted at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu), USA, where I worked on topics such as presentation attack detection in biometric systems, content-based image retrieval, and multimedia forensics.

I currently lead the Data Science and Management Group at LNLS, focusing on the development of solutions in data science, scientific data management, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and high-performance computing, applied to the analysis of experimental data from synchrotron radiation. I serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences in the field and I'm an active member of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (IEEE SPS), serving on the Education Board, where I contribute to international educational initiatives.
