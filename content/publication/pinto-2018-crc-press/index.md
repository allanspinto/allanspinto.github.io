abstract: 'This chapter explores data-driven approaches to presentation attack detection
  for three biometric modalities: face, iris, and fingerprint. The primary aim of
  this chapter is to show how pretrained deep neural networks can be used to build
  classifiers that can distinguish between authentic images of faces, irises, and
  fingerprints and their static imitations. The most important, publicly available
  benchmarks representing various attack types were used in a unified presentation
  attack detection framework in both same-dataset and cross-dataset experiments. The
  pretrained VGG neural networks, being the core of this solution, tuned independently
  for each modality and each dataset present almost perfect accuracy for all three
  biometric techniques. In turn, low-classification accuracies achieved in cross-dataset
  evaluations show that models based on deep neural networks are sensitive not only
  to features specific to biometric imitations, but also to dataset-specific properties
  of samples. Thus, such models can provide a rapid solution in scenarios in which
  properties of imitations can be predicted but appropriate feature engineering is
  difficult. However, these models will perform worse if the properties of imitations
  being detected are unknown. This chapter also includes a current literature review
  summarizing up-to-date data-driven solutions to face, iris and finger liveness detection.'
