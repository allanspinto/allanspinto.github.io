abstract: Pollution in the form of litter in the natural environment is one of the
  great challenges of our times. Automated litter detection can help assess waste
  occurrences in the environment. Different machine learning solutions have been explored
  to develop litter detection tools, thereby supporting research, citizen science,
  and volunteer clean-up initiatives. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work
  has investigated the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning object detection
  approaches in the context of litter detection. In particular, no studies have focused
  on the assessment of those methods aiming their use in devices with low processing
  capabilities, e.g., mobile phones, typically employed in citizen science activities.
  In this paper, we fill this literature gap. We performed a comparative study involving
  state-of-the-art CNN architectures (e.g., Faster RCNN, Mask-RCNN, EfficientDet,
  RetinaNet and YOLO-v5), two litter image datasets and a smartphone. We also introduce
  a new dataset for litter detection, named PlastOPol, composed of 2418 images and
  5300 annotations. The experimental results demonstrate that object detectors based
  on the YOLO family are promising for the construction of litter detection solutions,
  with superior performance in terms of detection accuracy, processing time, and memory
  footprint.
