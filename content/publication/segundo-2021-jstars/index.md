abstract: This work introduces a novel solution to measure economic activity through
  remote sensing for a wide range of spatial areas. We hypothesize that disturbances
  in human behavior caused by major life-changing events leave signatures in satellite
  imagery that allows devising relevant image-based indicators to estimate their impacts
  and support decision-makers. We present a case study for the COVID-19 coronavirus
  outbreak, which imposed severe mobility restrictions and caused worldwide disruptions,
  using flying airplane detection around the 30 busiest airports in Europe to quantify
  and analyze the lockdown's effects and post-lockdown recovery. Our solution won
  the Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation (RACE) upscaling challenge, sponsored
  by the European Space Agency and the European Commission, and now is integrated
  into the RACE dashboard. This platform combines satellite data and artificial intelligence
  to promote a progressive and safe reopening of essential activities. Code, trained
  model, and data are available at https://github.com/maups/covid19-custom-script-contest
