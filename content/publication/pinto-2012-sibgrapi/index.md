abstract: Recent advances on biometrics, information forensics, and security have
  improved the accuracy of biometric systems, mainly those based on facial information.
  However, an ever-growing challenge is the vulnerability of such systems to impostor
  attacks, in which users without access privileges try to authenticate themselves
  as valid users. In this work, we present a solution to video-based face spoofing
  to biometric systems. Such type of attack is characterized by presenting a video
  of a real user to the biometric system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first attempt of dealing with video-based face spoofing based in the analysis of
  global information that is invariant to video content. Our approach takes advantage
  of noise signatures generated by the recaptured video to distinguish between fake
  and valid access. To capture the noise and obtain a compact representation, we use
  the Fourier spectrum followed by the computation of the visual rhythm and extraction
  of the gray-level co-occurrence matrices, used as feature descriptors. Results show
  the effectiveness of the proposed approach to distinguish between valid and fake
  users for video-based spoofing with near-perfect classification results.
