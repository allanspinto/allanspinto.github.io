abstract: The study of brain connectivity has been a cornerstone in understanding
  the complexities of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It has provided invaluable
  insights into the functional architecture of the brain and how it is perturbed in
  disorders. However, a persistent challenge has been achieving the proper spatial
  resolution, and developing computational algorithms to address biological questions
  at the multi-cellular level, a scale often referred to as the mesoscale. Historically,
  neuroimaging studies of brain connectivity have predominantly focused on the macroscale,
  providing insights into inter-regional brain connections but often falling short
  of resolving the intricacies of neural circuitry at the cellular or mesoscale level.
  This limitation has hindered our ability to fully comprehend the underlying mechanisms
  of neurological and psychiatric disorders and to develop targeted interventions.
  In light of this issue, our review manuscript seeks to bridge this critical gap
  by delving into the domain of mesoscale neuroimaging. We aim to provide a comprehensive
  overview of conditions affected by aberrant neural connections, image acquisition
  techniques, feature extraction, and data analysis methods that are specifically
  tailored to the mesoscale. We further delineate the potential of brain connectivity
  research to elucidate complex biological questions, with a particular focus on schizophrenia
  and epilepsy. This review encompasses topics such as dendritic spine quantification,
  single neuron morphology, and brain region connectivity. We aim to showcase the
  applicability and significance of mesoscale neuroimaging techniques in the field
  of neuroscience, highlighting their potential for gaining insights into the complexities
  of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
