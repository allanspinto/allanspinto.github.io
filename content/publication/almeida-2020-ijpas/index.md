abstract: The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant variables to characterise
  the performance level of the teams through Men's World Championships (2007-2019).
  Forty-seven attributes from match-related statistics and characteristics of players
  were analysed in 168 participant teams. Descriptive discriminant analysis classified
  correctly 69.6% of the cases and selected the height of players, 9-m efficiency,
  international matches disputed, wing efficiency, blocked shots, 7-m goalkeeper efficiency
  and 2-min suspensions which were the most relevant indicators. Top-Elite was significantly
  different (one-way ANOVA) from Middle- and Low-Elite in all variables selected,
  except for 7-m goalkeeper efficiency. Linear regression shows that wing efficiency
  and blocked shots were the only variables with a tendency of changes through seven
  editions. The best teams have the tallest players and with more international matches
  disputed, were most efficient in 9-m and wing finalisations and block more shots
  in defence. These findings may guide scientists and sports trainers to select players,
  prescribe training procedures, analyse opponents and establish match strategies
  with special attention to these variables.
