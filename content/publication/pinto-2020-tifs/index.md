abstract: Presentation attack detection is a challenging problem that aims at exposing
  an impostor user seeking to deceive the authentication system. In facial biometrics
  systems, this kind of attack is performed using a photograph, video, or 3D mask
  containing the biometric information of a genuine identity. In this paper, we propose
  a novel approach to detecting face presentation attacks based on intrinsic properties
  of the scene such as albedo, depth, and reflectance properties of the facial surfaces,
  which were recovered through a shape-from-shading (SfS) algorithm. To extract meaningful
  patterns from the different maps obtained with the SfS algorithm, we designed a
  novel shallow CNN architecture for learning features useful to the presentation
  attack detection (PAD). We performed several experiments considering the intra-
  and inter-dataset evaluation protocols. The obtained results showed the effectiveness
  of the proposed method considering several types of photo- and video-based presentation
  attacks, and in the cross-sensor scenario, besides achieving competitive results  for
  the inter-dataset evaluation protocol.
