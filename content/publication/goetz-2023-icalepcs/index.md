abstract: 'The ICAT metadata catalogue is a flexible solution for managing scientific
  metadata and data from a wide variety of domains following the FAIR data principles.
  This paper will present an update of recent developments of the ICAT metadata catalogue
  and the latest status of the ICAT collaboration. ICAT was originally developed by
  UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) to manage the scientific data
  of ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and Diamond Light Source. They have since been joined
  by a number of other institutes including ESRF, HZB, SESAME, and ALBA who together
  now form the ICAT Collaboration. ICAT has been used to manage petabytes of scientific
  data for ISIS, DLS, ESRF, HZB, and in the future SESAME and ALBA and make these
  data FAIR. The latest version of the ICAT core as well as the new user interfaces,
  DataGateway and DataHub, and extensions to ICAT for implementing free text searching,
  a common search interface across Photon and Neutron catalogues, a protocol-based
  interface that allows making the metadata available for findability, electronic
  logbooks, sample tracking, and web-based data and domain specific viewers developed
  by the community will be presented. Finally recent developments to use ICAT to develop
  applications for processed data with rich metadata in the fields of small angle
  scattering, macromolecular crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be
  described. https://icatproject.org '
