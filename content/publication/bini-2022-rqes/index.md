abstract: ' ABSTRACTPurpose: With the increased access to neural networks trained
  to estimate body segments from images and videos, this study assessed the validity
  of some of these networks in enabling the assessment of body position on the bicycle.
  Methods: Fourteen cyclists pedaled stationarily in one session on their own bicycles
  while video was recorded from their sagittal plane. Reflective markers attached
  to key bony landmarks were used to manually digitize joint angles at two positions
  of the crank (3 o’clock and 6 o’clock) extracted from the videos (Reference method).
  These angles were compared to measurements taken from videos generated by two deep
  learning-based approaches designed to automatically estimate human joints (Microsoft
  Research Asia-MSRA and OpenPose). Results: Mean bias for OpenPose ranged between
  0.03° and 1.81°, while the MSRA method presented errors between 2.29° and 12.15°.
  Correlation coefficients were stronger for OpenPose than for the MSRA method in
  relation to the Reference method for the torso (r = 0.94 vs. 0.92), hip (r = 0.69
  vs. 0.60), knee (r = 0.80 vs. 0.71), and ankle (r = 0.23 vs. 0.20). Conclusion:
  OpenPose presented better accuracy than the MSRA method in determining body position
  on the bicycle, but both methods seem comparable in assessing implications from
  changes in bicycle configuration. '
