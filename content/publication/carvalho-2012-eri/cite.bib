However, their authenticity is usually a doubtful question, since tampering digital documents have been become a simple task through using existent manipulation tools. So, our trust on digital documents is constantly decreasing, making necessary to develop effective approaches to recover this trust.

Based on this, our work presents a forensics computing overview showing main kind of forensics problems and most recently approaches to treat them.},
