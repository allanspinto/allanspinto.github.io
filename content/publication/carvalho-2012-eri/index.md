abstract: An astonishing number of digital documents, such as digital pictures, videos,
  text files, etc., are daily produced and broadcasted. However, their authenticity
  is usually a doubtful question, since tampering digital documents have been become
  a simple task through using existent manipulation tools. So, our trust on digital
  documents is constantly decreasing, making necessary to develop effective approaches
  to recover this trust. All these facts highlight the importance of digital forensics
  in our day-by-day life. Based on this, our work presents a forensics computing overview
  showing main kind of forensics problems and most recently approaches to treat them.
