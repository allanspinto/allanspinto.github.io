abstract: Marine plastic pollution has in recent decades become ubiquitous, posing
  threats to flora, fauna, and potentially human health. Proper monitoring and registration
  of litter occurrences are, therefore, of paramount importance to support better-informed
  decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the PlastOPol marine litter monitoring
  system. PlastOPol integrates external data sources on beached litter with data collected
  through citizen science initiatives based on the use of a mobile application (App).
  The App relies on state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches for litter detection
  and registration. The system also supports a human-in-the-loop strategy based on
  which improved versions of litter detection models are created over time thanks
  to annotations by citizen scientists. Finally, the system includes a geographic
  visualization tool to support the analysis of litter distribution data by decision-makers.
  This system has the potential to create a direct path between citizens, researchers,
  and decision-makers on the issue of marine litter. Finally, the paper presents compelling
  usage scenarios of the proposed monitoring system and discusses the evaluation of
  the App through a user study. The user study suggests that the PlastOPol system
  is an effective and valuable tool to monitor and communicate marine litter.
