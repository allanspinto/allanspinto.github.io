abstract: This article addresses the pixelwise classification problem based on temporal
  profiles, which are encoded in 2-D representations based on recurrence plots, Gramian
  angular/ difference fields, and Markov transition field. We propose a multirepresentational
  fusion scheme that exploits the complementary view provided by those time series
  representations and different data-driven feature extractors and classifiers. We
  validate our ensemble scheme in the problem related to the classification of eucalyptus
  plantations in remote sensing images. Achieved results demonstrate that our proposal
  overcomes recently proposed baselines, and now represents the new state-of-the-art
  classification solution for the target dataset.
