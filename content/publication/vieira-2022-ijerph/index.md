abstract: Kicking is a fundamental skill in soccer that often contributes to match
  outcomes. Lower limb movement features (e.g., joint position and velocity) are determinants
  of kick performance. However, obtaining kicking kinematics under field conditions
  generally requires time-consuming manual tracking. The current study aimed to compare
  a contemporary markerless automatic motion estimation algorithm (OpenPose) with
  manual digitisation (DVIDEOW software) in obtaining on-field kicking kinematic parameters.
  An experimental dataset of under-17 players from all outfield positions was used.
  Kick attempts were performed in an official pitch against a goalkeeper. Four digital
  video cameras were used to record full-body motion during support and ball contact
  phases of each kick. Three-dimensional positions of hip, knee, ankle, toe and foot
  centre-of-mass (CMfoot) generally showed no significant differences when computed
  by automatic as compared to manual tracking (whole kicking movement cycle), while
  only z-coordinates of knee and calcaneus markers at specific points differed between
  methods. The resulting time-series matrices of positions (r2 = 0.94) and velocity
  signals (r2 = 0.68) were largely associated (all p &lt; 0.01). The mean absolute
  error of OpenPose motion tracking was 3.49 cm for determining positions (ranging
  from 2.78 cm (CMfoot) to 4.13 cm (dominant hip)) and 1.29 m/s for calculating joint
  velocity (0.95 m/s (knee) to 1.50 m/s (non-dominant hip)) as compared to reference
  measures by manual digitisation. Angular range-of-motion showed significant correlations
  between methods for the ankle (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.01, large) and knee joint displacements
  (r = 0.84, p &lt; 0.001, very large) but not in the hip (r = 0.04, p = 0.85, unclear).
  Markerless motion tracking (OpenPose) can help to successfully obtain some lower
  limb position, velocity, and joint angular outputs during kicks performed in a naturally
  occurring environment.
