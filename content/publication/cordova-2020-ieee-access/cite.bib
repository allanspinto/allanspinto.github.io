 abstract = {Scene text detection has become an important field in the computer vision area due to the increasing number of applications. This is a very challenging problem as textual elements are commonly found in “noisy” and complex natural scenes. Another issue refers to the presence of texts encoded into different languages within the same image. State-of-the-art solutions rely on the use of deep neural network approaches or even ensembles of them. However, such solutions are associated with “heavy” models, which are computationally expensive in terms of memory and storage footprints, which hampers their use in real-time mobile applications. In this work, we introduce Pelee-Text++, a lightweight neural network architecture for multi-lingual multi-oriented scene text detection, especially tailored to running on devices with computational restrictions. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate the performance of text detection methods in commercial smartphones. Over this scenario, Pelee-Text++ processes 2.94 frames per second and it is the only evaluated approach that did not cause memory issues on smartphones, even using an input image of  $1024\times 1024$  pixels. Our proposal achieves a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, with a model size of 27 Megabytes and F-measure of 91.20%, 85.78%, 81.72%, 80.30%, 82.53% and 66.51% on ICDAR 2011, ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, MSRA-TD500, ReCTS 2019 and Multi-lingual 2019 datasets, respectively.},
