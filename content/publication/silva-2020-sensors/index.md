abstract: Energy and storage restrictions are relevant variables that software applications
  should be concerned about when running in low-power environments. In particular,
  computer vision (CV) applications exemplify well that concern, since conventional
  uniform image sensors typically capture large amounts of data to be further handled
  by the appropriate CV algorithms. Moreover, much of the acquired data are often
  redundant and outside of the application's interest, which leads to unnecessary
  processing and energy spending. In the literature, techniques for sensing and re-sampling
  images in non-uniform fashions have emerged to cope with these problems. In this
  study, we propose Application-Oriented Retinal Image Models that define a space-variant
  configuration of uniform images and contemplate requirements of energy consumption
  and storage footprints for CV applications. We hypothesize that our models might
  decrease energy consumption in CV tasks. Moreover, we show how to create the models
  and validate their use in a face detection/recognition application, evidencing the
  compromise between storage, energy, and accuracy.
