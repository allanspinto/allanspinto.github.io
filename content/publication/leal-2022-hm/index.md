abstract: Dribbling is a meaningful skill in soccer, due to its effectiveness to create
  opportunities for scoring. Several studies analyzed dribbling actions from different
  perspectives, including among others, the development of talented players. Despite
  recent progresses, however, there is still no consensus about the definition of
  dribbling. This study proposes a more comprehensive definition than earlier applied,
  considering the key elements present in other proposals found in the literature.
  This study aims to validate the proposed definition considering evaluations with
  three experts working with events from the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ contest and
  also to apply the proposed definition in the analysis of the effectiveness of dribbling
  actions performed by elite players when playing for their respective national teams.
  We designed a protocol to collect the opinion from experts regarding the classification
  of events as dribble or non-dribble. To evaluate the quality of experts' opinions
  working with the novel dribbling definition, we computed the accuracy and precision,
  and Krippendorff's alpha coefficient to measure the agreement between them. On average,
  the accuracy and precision values reach $96.25±4.51%$, and $97.08±1.91%$ and an
  agreement rate of $0.93$. The obtained results indicate that our definition of dribbling
  was clear and easily understood by the experts, which suggests that it could be
  useful to support soccer scouting of dribbling actions. Furthermore, the agreement
  value showed a near-perfect consensus between experts. We also analysed the effectiveness
  of dribbling actions considering the number of dribbles per 90 minutes played and
  success rate distributions for different national teams and their respective players
  that participated of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™.
