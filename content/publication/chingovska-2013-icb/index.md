abstract: As a crucial security problem, anti-spoofing in biometrics, and particularly
  for the face modality, has achieved great progress in the recent years. Still, new
  threats arrive inform of better, more realistic and more sophisticated spoofing
  attacks. The objective of the 2nd Competition on Counter Measures to 2D Face Spoofing
  Attacks is to challenge researchers to create counter measures effectively detecting
  a variety of attacks. The submitted propositions are evaluated on the Replay-Attack
  database and the achieved results are presented in this paper.
