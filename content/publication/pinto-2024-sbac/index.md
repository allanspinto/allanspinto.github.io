abstract: ' This paper introduces DeepWave, a novel software stack, and methodology
  designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence into traditional seismic
  surveying techniques, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of geophysical
  exploration. By utilizing advanced machine learning frameworks such as JAX, FLAX,
  and ALPA, DeepWave employs a parallelization strategy for image-to-image translation
  networks, optimizing the seismic data interpretation process. DeepWave reduces the
  computational demands of intensive geophysical algorithms, such as Full-waveform
  Inversion (FWI), while maintaining the accuracy required for detailed subsurface
  analysis. This method enables faster and more efficient processing of large seismic
  datasets, providing deeper insights into the Earthâ€™s subsurface structures with
  reduced computational resources. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement
  in processing speed and resource management, establishing a new geophysical research
  and exploration standard. '
