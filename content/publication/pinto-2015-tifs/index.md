abstract: Spoofing attacks or impersonation can be easily accomplished in a facial
  biometric system wherein users without access privileges attempt to authenticate
  themselves as valid users, in which an impostor needs only a photograph or a video
  with facial information of a legitimate user. Even with recent advances in biometrics,
  information forensics and security, vulnerability of facial biometric systems against
  spoofing attacks is still an open problem. Even though several methods have been
  proposed for photo-based spoofing attack detection, attacks performed with videos
  have been vastly overlooked, which hinders the use of the facial biometric systems
  in modern applications. In this paper, we present an algorithm for video-based spoofing
  attack detection through the analysis of global information which is invariant to
  content, since we discard video contents and analyze content-independent noise signatures
  present in the video related to the unique acquisition processes. Our approach takes
  advantage of noise signatures generated by the recaptured video to distinguish between
  fake and valid access videos. For that, we use the Fourier spectrum followed by
  the computation of video visual rhythms and the extraction of different characterization
  methods. For evaluation, we consider the novel unicamp video-attack database, which
  comprises 17 076 videos composed of real access and spoofing attack videos. In addition,
  we evaluate the proposed method using the replay-attack database, which contains
  photo-based and video-based face spoofing attacks.
