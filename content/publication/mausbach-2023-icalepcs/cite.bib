 abstract = {Synchrotron radiation facilities comprise beamlines designed to perform a wide range of X-ray experimental techniques which require complex instruments to monitor thermodynamic variables, sample-related variables, among others. Thus, synchrotron beamlines can produce heterogeneous sets of data and metadata, hereafter referred to as data, which impose several challenges to standardizing them. For open science and FAIR principles, such standardization is paramount for research reproducibility, besides accelerating the development of scalable and reusable data-driven solutions. To address this issue, the Assonant was devised to collect and standardize the data produced at beamlines of Sirius, the Brazilian fourth-generation synchrotron light source. This solution enables a NeXus-compliant technique-centric data standard at Sirius transparently for beamline teams by removing the burden of standardization tasks from them and providing a unified standardization solution for several techniques at Sirius. The Assonant implements a software interface to abstract data format-related specificities and to send the produced data to an event-driven infrastructure composed of streaming processing and microservices, able to transform the data flow according to NeXus. This paper presents the development process of Assonant, the strategy adopted to standardize beamlines with different operating stages, and challenges faced during the standardization process for macromolecular crystallography and imaging data at Sirius.},
