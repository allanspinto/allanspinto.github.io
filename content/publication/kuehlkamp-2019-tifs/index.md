abstract: The adoption of large-scale iris recognition systems around the world has
  brought to light the importance of detecting presentation attack images (textured
  contact lenses and printouts). This paper presents a new approach in iris presentation
  attack detection (PAD) by exploring combinations of convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) and transformed input spaces through binarized statistical image features
  (BSIFs). Our method combines lightweight CNNs to classify multiple BSIF views of
  the input image. Following explorations on complementary input spaces leading to
  more discriminative features to detect presentation attacks, we also propose an
  algorithm to select the best (and most discriminative) predictors for the task at
  hand. An ensemble of predictors makes use of their expected individual performances
  to aggregate their results into a final prediction. Results show that this technique
  improves on the current state of the art in iris PAD, outperforming the winner of
  LivDet-Iris 2017 competition both for intra- and cross-dataset scenarios, and illustrating
  the very difficult nature of the cross-dataset scenario.
