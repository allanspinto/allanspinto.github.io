abstract: 'Biometric systems are prevalent in access control but are vulnerable to
  frauds. A typical attempt of violating them is through presentation attacks, in
  which synthetic data is directly presented to an acquisition sensor to deceive these
  systems. A well-designed biometric system should have a presentation attack detection
  (PAD) module. A fruitful way to perform PAD is to model properties of peculiar traits
  (artifacts) in synthetic data. Studies have been advocating for approaches that
  seek to model the artifacts automatically from data (data-driven), achieving state-of-the-art
  results in PAD. However, the following questions arise from this literature: Which
  approaches are the state of the art? When do these approaches fail? How can such
  approaches complement the proposed ones based on human knowledge on PAD? How robust
  are these approaches under cross-dataset scenarios? Are these approaches robust
  against new attack types (e.g., face morphing)? Do these methods provide other ways
  to perform PAD, for example, using open-set classifiers rather than the classical
  binary formulation? Are these methods applicable to the multi-biometric setting?
  In this chapter, we address these questions through a literature review, focusing
  on three biometric modalities: face, fingerprint, and iris.'
