abstract: 'This study investigated the effects of inspiratory muscle pre-activation
  (IMPA) on the interactions among the technical-tactical, physical, physiological,
  and psychophysiological parameters in a simulated judo match, based on the centrality
  metrics by complex network model. Ten male athletes performed 4 experimental sessions.
  Firstly, anthropometric measurements, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and global
  strenght of the inspiratory muscles  were determined. In the following days, all
  athletes performed four-minute video-recorded judo matches, under three conditions:
  without IMPA (CON), after IMPA at 15% (IMPA15), and at 40% (IMPA40) of MIP using
  an exerciser device. Blood lactate, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion
  were monitored, and the technical-tactical parameters during the match were related
  to offensive actions and the time-motion. Based on the complex network, graphs were
  constructed for each scenario (CON, IMPA15, and IMPA40) to investigate the Degree
  and Pagerank centrality metrics. IMPA40 increased the connectivity of the physical
  and technical-tactical parameters in complex network and highlighted the combat
  frequency and average combat time in top-five ranked nodes. IMPA15 also favoured
  the interactions among the psychophysiological, physical, and physiological parameters.
  Our results suggest the positive effects of the IMPA, indicating this strategy to
  prepare the organism (IMPA15) and to improve performance (IMPA40) in judo match.'
