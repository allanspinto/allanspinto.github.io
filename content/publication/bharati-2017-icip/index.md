abstract: Deriving relationships between images and tracing back their history of
  modifications are at the core of Multimedia Phylogeny solutions, which aim to combat
  misinformation through doctored visual media. Nonetheless, most recent image phylogeny
  solutions cannot properly address cases of forged composite images with multiple
  donors, an area known as multiple parenting phylogeny (MPP). This paper presents
  a preliminary undirected graph construction solution for MPP, without any strict
  assumptions. The algorithm is underpinned by robust image representative keypoints
  and different geometric consistency checks among matching regions in both images
  to provide regions of interest for direct comparison. The paper introduces a novel
  technique to geometrically filter the most promising matches as well as to aid in
  the shared region localization task. The strength of the approach is corroborated
  by experiments with real-world cases, with and without image distractors (unrelated
  cases).
