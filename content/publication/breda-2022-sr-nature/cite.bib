 abstract = {This study investigated the 30-days altitude training (2500 m, LHTH-live and training high) on hematological responses and aerobic--anaerobic performances parameters of high-level Paralympic athletes. Aerobic capacity was assessed by 3000 m run, and anaerobic variables (velocity, force and mechanical power) by a maximal 30-s semi-tethered running test (AO30). These assessments were carried out at low altitude before (PRE) and after LHTH (5--6 and 15--16 days, POST1 and POST2, respectively). During LHTH, hematological analyzes were performed on days 1, 12, 20 and 30. After LHTH, aerobic performance decreased 1.7% in POST1, but showed an amazing increase in POST2 (15.4 s reduction in the 3000 m test, 2.8%). Regarding anaerobic parameters, athletes showed a reduction in velocity, force and power in POST1, but velocity and power returned to their initial conditions in POST2. In addition, all participants had higher hemoglobin (Hb) values at the end of LHTH (30 days), but at POST2 these results were close to those of PRE. The centrality metrics obtained by complex networks (pondered degree, pagerank and betweenness) in the PRE and POST2 scenarios highlighted hemoglobin, hematocrit (Hct) and minimum force, velocity and power, suggesting these variables on the way to increasing endurance performance. The Jaccard's distance metrics showed dissimilarity between the PRE and POST2 graphs, and Hb and Hct as more prominent nodes for all centrality metrics. These results indicate that adaptive process from LHTH was highlighted by the complex networks, which can help understanding the better aerobic performance at low altitude after 16 days in Paralympic athletes.},
