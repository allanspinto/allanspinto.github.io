abstract: Despite important recent advances, the vulnerability of biometric systems
  to spoofing attacks is still an open problem. Spoof attacks occur when impostor
  users present synthetic biometric samples of a valid user to the biometric system
  seeking to deceive it. Considering the case of face biometrics, a spoofing attack
  consists in presenting a fake sample (e.g., photograph, digital video, or even a
  3D mask) to the acquisition sensor with the facial information of a valid user.
  In this paper, we introduce a low cost and software-based method for detecting spoofing
  attempts in face recognition systems. Our hypothesis is that during acquisition,
  there will be inevitable artifacts left behind in the recaptured biometric samples
  allowing us to create a discriminative signature of the video generated by the biometric
  sensor. To characterize these artifacts, we extract time-spectral feature descriptors
  from the video, which can be understood as a low-level feature descriptor that gathers
  temporal and spectral information across the biometric sample and use the visual
  codebook concept to find mid-level feature descriptors computed from the low-level
  ones. Such descriptors are more robust for detecting several kinds of attacks than
  the low-level ones. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed
  method for detecting different types of attacks in a variety of scenarios and data
  sets, including photos, videos, and 3D masks.
