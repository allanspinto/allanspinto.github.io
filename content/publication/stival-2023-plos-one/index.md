abstract: Sports sciences are increasingly data-intensive nowadays since computational
  tools can extract information from large amounts of data and derive insights from
  athlete performances during the competition. This paper addresses a performance
  prediction problem in soccer, a popular collective sport modality played by two
  teams competing against each other in the same field. In a soccer game, teams score
  points by placing the ball into the opponent’s goal and the winner is the team with
  the highest count of goals. Retaining possession of the ball is one key to success,
  but it is not enough since a team needs to score to achieve victory, which requires
  an offensive toward the opponent’s goal. The focus of this work is to determine
  if analyzing the first five seconds after the control of the ball is taken by one
  of the teams provides enough information to determine whether the ball will reach
  the final quarter of the soccer field, therefore creating a goal-scoring chance.
  By doing so, we can further investigate which conditions increase strategic leverage.
  Our approach comprises modeling players’ interactions as graph structures and extracting
  metrics from these structures. These metrics, when combined, form time series that
  we encode in two-dimensional representations of visual rhythms, allowing feature
  extraction through deep convolutional networks, coupled with a classifier to predict
  the outcome (whether the final quarter of the field is reached). The results indicate
  that offensive play near the adversary penalty area can be predicted by looking
  at the first five seconds. Finally, the explainability of our models reveals the
  main metrics along with its contributions for the final inference result, which
  corroborates other studies found in the literature for soccer match analysis.
