abstract: Recent advances in machine learning and scientific visualization have revolutionized
  the industry with novel applications and services that deeply impacted human life
  mainly. However, state-of-the-art machine learning models, especially deep models,
  are highly dependent on reliable data alongside their respective annotations. Unfortunately,
  label annotation is a time-consuming and costly task, especially for applications
  that require manual annotation performed by experts with special skills and domain
  knowledge. In this scenario, methods that assist experts to perform annotations
  effectively have a major impact on deploying reliable machine learning models. This
  article proposes a modern web application, called Annotat3D, that implements an
  interactive segmentation workflow at the Sirius/LNLS facility, enabling experts
  to perform fast and accurate tomographic volume labeling in high-performance computing
  (HPC) environment. As a result, the proposed application greatly impacts the workflow
  of both experts and non-experts users of Sirius' beamlines, since most of the tools
  available for image analysis and visualization are not optimized to operate in HPC
  environments. Our methodology takes advantage of recent developments in network
  communication to efficiently exchange data load in main memory between two-node
  clusters and modern web-based frameworks that allow us to build an efficient, clean,
  and simple graphical user interface.
