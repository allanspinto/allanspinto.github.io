abstract: As image tampering becomes ever more sophisticated and commonplace, the
  need for image forensics algorithms that can accurately and quickly detect forgeries
  grows. In this paper, we revisit the ideas of image querying and retrieval to provide
  clues to better localize forgeries. We propose a method to perform large-scale image
  forensics on the order of one million images using the help of an image search algorithm
  and database to gather contextual clues as to where tampering may have taken place.
  In this vein, we introduce five new strongly invariant image comparison methods
  and test their effectiveness under heavy noise, rotation, and color space changes.
  Lastly, we show the effectiveness of these methods compared to passive image forensics
  using Nimble [1], a new, state-of-the-art dataset from the National Institute of
  Standards and Technology (NIST).
